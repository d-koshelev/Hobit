# Architecture

This document describes the current repository structure and intended future architecture for Hobit.

The current repository contains a root Rust workspace that includes the core crates and the Tauri desktop shell, a Vite/React frontend, a minimal Tauri workspace bridge, and a SQLite workspace persistence foundation. No agents, real widgets, terminal execution, runtime execution, or tool implementations exist yet.

## Documentation Contracts

`DESIGN_SYSTEM_CONTRACT.md` defines the base visual language for future frontend and widget work.

## Current Repository Skeleton

The implemented skeleton is:

```text
apps/
  desktop/
    README.md
    frontend/
      README.md
    src-tauri/
      README.md
      Cargo.toml
      tauri.conf.json

crates/
  hobit-core/
  hobit-storage-sqlite/
  hobit-agent/
  hobit-tools/
  hobit-app/
```

The root `Cargo.toml` defines a Rust workspace for `apps/desktop/src-tauri` and the five crates under `crates/`. Root workspace validation checks the Tauri desktop shell and the core crates together.

`hobit-core` contains minimal domain contract types.

`hobit-storage-sqlite` contains the initial idempotent SQLite schema and row-level storage primitives.

`hobit-agent` and `hobit-tools` are placeholder crates with package metadata and crate-level documentation. `hobit-app` contains the current Workspace application service foundation.

`apps/desktop/frontend` contains the current workspace/start screen and Empty Workbench frontend. `apps/desktop/src-tauri` contains a minimal Tauri 2 desktop shell that hosts the frontend and exposes workspace lifecycle/state commands.

## Current Frontend Milestone

A Vite, React, and TypeScript frontend scaffold exists under `apps/desktop/frontend`.

The current UI starts with a Workspace Start Screen shell. In the Tauri desktop shell, creating or opening a workspace calls the Tauri workspace lifecycle commands, loads the Workspace Workbench state through the workspace API facade, maps it into `WorkbenchViewState`, and then opens the Empty Workbench shell.

In plain browser/Vite development, the frontend uses an in-memory workspace API fallback so the start screen remains usable without Tauri. Browser fallback state is not persisted, and its Workbench state remains an in-memory empty surface.

The Empty Workbench shell intentionally renders no concrete widgets by default.

The frontend includes a Widget Catalog drawer opened from Add Widget controls. The catalog renders display-only planned widget template metadata. These templates are not registered widget definitions and there is still no runtime widget insertion or Tauri-backed widget catalog behavior.

There is no terminal execution, agent runtime, widget insertion behavior, preset editor, or layout persistence editing yet.

## Current Desktop Shell Milestone

`apps/desktop/src-tauri` now contains a minimal Tauri 2 desktop shell for Hobit.

The shell loads the frontend dev server at `http://127.0.0.1:5173` during development and uses `apps/desktop/frontend/dist` for production frontend assets.

This milestone hosts the existing frontend and allows it to call the workspace lifecycle commands when running inside Tauri.

## Current Tauri Workspace Bridge Milestone

The Tauri shell initializes a local SQLite database at `hobit.sqlite3` in the Tauri app data directory.

On startup, the shell creates the app data directory if needed and runs the idempotent SQLite schema initialization.

The shell exposes minimal WorkspaceService lifecycle commands over the Tauri bridge:

- `create_workspace`
- `list_workspaces`
- `get_workspace_summary`
- `open_workspace`
- `get_workspace_workbench_state`

The current Tauri bridge source keeps app state and SQLite initialization in `app_state.rs`, Workspace command handlers in `workspace_commands.rs`, and command DTO mapping in `workspace_dto.rs`.

The React frontend calls these commands from the Workspace Start Screen when running inside Tauri. The browser/Vite path uses the same workspace API facade with an in-memory implementation. There is no widget runtime behavior, widget insertion, terminal execution, agent call, workspace restore runtime, or settings UI in this milestone.

## Current Workbench State Command Milestone

`hobit-app` can now return a canonical Workspace Workbench state summary for a Workspace. The summary includes the Workspace, current Workbench, persisted widget instance summaries, shared state object summaries, and stored Workbench event summaries.

The Tauri shell exposes this through `get_workspace_workbench_state`, backed by the existing local SQLite store and `WorkspaceService`.

The frontend consumes this command through its workspace API boundary and adapts the response into `WorkbenchViewState` before rendering the Workbench. There is still no event replay, runtime reconstruction, widget execution, terminal execution, or agent call behavior.

## Current Workspace Flow

The implemented desktop flow is:

```text
Create or open Workspace
  -> WorkspaceService creates or opens a WorkspaceSession
  -> frontend requests get_workspace_workbench_state
  -> Tauri bridge returns persisted Workspace/Workbench summary state
  -> frontend workspace API adapts it into WorkbenchViewState
  -> Empty Workbench renders from that view state
```

The browser/Vite flow keeps the same frontend boundary but uses in-memory Workspace and Workbench state instead of the Tauri bridge and SQLite store.

## Current Frontend Workspace Shell Milestone

The Workspace Start Screen reflects the intended user flow: open Hobit, create a local Workspace shell, then enter the Empty Workbench for the selected preset.

This milestone uses Tauri workspace commands in desktop mode and an in-memory frontend fallback in browser mode. It loads persisted Workbench summary state before entering the Workbench, but it does not implement runtime restoration, widget runtime state restoration, widget insertion, or persisted browser fallback state.

## Current Frontend Widget Milestone

The frontend now has a small `WidgetDefinition`, `WidgetInstance`, and `WorkbenchPreset` model.

The Empty Workbench is rendered from preset data and currently contains no visible widget instances.

`WidgetHost` remains the single future mapping layer from widget instances to React components. The current frontend registry is intentionally empty.

The Widget Catalog has frontend-only planned template metadata for future capabilities. The registry is frontend-local and empty for now. There is no runtime widget loading or widget insertion through the Tauri bridge yet.

## Current Core Model Milestone

`hobit-core` now contains minimal Rust domain contracts for Workspace, Workbench, Presets, Widgets, Actions, Events, and Shared State.

These are pure domain contracts only. Persistence, frontend integration, and Tauri integration live outside `hobit-core`.

## Current SQLite Storage Milestone

`hobit-storage-sqlite` now has idempotent SQLite schema initialization.

It stores Workspace, WorkspaceSession, Workbench/Preset, WidgetInstance, WidgetRun/Log/Result, SharedState, and WorkbenchEvent primitives.

This storage layer is foundational only. It is wired through `hobit-app` and the minimal Tauri workspace lifecycle/state bridge, but not to agent runtime, terminal execution, concrete widget behavior, or widget insertion yet.

## Current Application Service Milestone

`hobit-app` now provides a minimal `WorkspaceService` over SQLite storage.

The service creates empty Workspaces with one associated empty Workbench, opens Workspaces by creating WorkspaceSession rows, appends basic Workbench events, and returns simple Workspace and WorkspaceSession summaries.

This application layer is wired to the minimal Tauri workspace lifecycle bridge. It does not restore runtime state, execute widgets, run agents, execute terminal commands, or add UI behavior.

## Workspace Model Boundary

The current Workspace model foundation supports persisted Workspace records, WorkspaceSession records, empty Workbench records, widget instance summaries, shared state summaries, and Workbench event summaries.

Full runtime restore is not implemented yet. There is no event replay, widget runtime reconstruction, preset editor, layout editor, real widget insertion, terminal execution, or agent runtime behavior.

## Planned Notes Model

Future notes work will support Markdown documents organized in folders with global and workspace-local scopes.

This is not implemented yet. There is no notes storage, notes widget implementation, folder UI, Markdown editor, sync, or Knowledge ingestion flow in the current repository.

## Intended Repository Layout

Future implementation may extend the skeleton into a structure similar to:

```text
apps/
  desktop/
    frontend/
      src/
        app/
        design-system/
        workbench/
        widgets/
        state/
    src-tauri/

crates/
  hobit-core/
  hobit-storage-sqlite/
  hobit-agent/
  hobit-tools/
  hobit-app/
```

## Intended Responsibilities

`apps/desktop` is intended to host the desktop shell when the app implementation begins.

`apps/desktop/frontend` is intended to hold the future frontend app, design system, workbench shell, widget UI, and frontend state coordination.

`apps/desktop/src-tauri` holds the current minimal Tauri desktop shell and future native bridge work.

`crates/hobit-core` is intended to hold core domain contracts and shared models.

`crates/hobit-storage-sqlite` owns the current local SQLite persistence foundation.

`crates/hobit-agent` is intended to hold agent runtime integration.

`crates/hobit-tools` is intended to hold structured tool capabilities and action execution boundaries.

`crates/hobit-app` is intended to hold application orchestration.

## Current Boundary

The current repository state is documentation, repository hygiene, a root Rust workspace including the Tauri shell, core Rust domain/storage/application crates, a frontend Workspace Start Screen and Empty Workbench shell, a display-only Widget Catalog drawer, a minimal Tauri desktop host, and SQLite-backed workspace/workbench state loading in desktop mode.

Future feature implementation must preserve the Workbench-first, widget-first, approval-aware contracts while adding real widgets, runtime behavior, and editing capabilities intentionally.
